# Project Name : Donation Campaign 

**Project Description**: My project is a web application that facilitates online donations and tracks donation statistics. Users can explore various donation categories, view details of specific donations, and even contribute to them. The application ensures users have access to up-to-date information and provides an interactive pie chart for visualizing donation data, enhancing the overall user experience.

## Features

- **Robust Data Fetching Mechanism**
  - I've implemented a reliable data fetching mechanism.
  - It retrieves data from an external source.
  - This enhances my application's ability to provide up-to-date information to users.
  - Users can always access the latest content and statistics.

- **Data Storage in LocalStorage**
  - To enhance the user experience, I've implemented data storage in the browser's LocalStorage.
  - This enables users to access specific information even when offline or after closing and reopening the application.
  - Users can seamlessly retrieve previously viewed content and settings.

### 3. Data Visualization with Pie Chart

In my application, I offer data visualization through an interactive pie chart. Users can easily grasp and analyze donation statistics and trends. This visual representation enhances the user's understanding of the data and contributes to a more engaging user experience.
